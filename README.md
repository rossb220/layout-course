# layout course

This is my implementation to a css layout [course](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts) challenge I completed for practice. This repo
contains a pdf (named challenge-specs.pdf) which is a design made by the course leader. I then went ahead and implemented the html/css as per the challenge.
